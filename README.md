# LP_exercise
Local Projects coding exercise

LP_exercise represents one day of work on an coding exercise intended to evaluate employment with Local Projects in New York.

This project was created on June 12, 2017 in Unity3D version 4.5.3f1. The project is currently set to build as a Standalone app at 16:9 aspect ratio; however, these settings are dynamic.

The backend solution provided for this project is an external SQLite DB that is being saved to the applications persistent data folder.  On my system this folder is located here:

/Users/username/Library/Application Support/DefaultCompany/localProjects_exercise/LP_exercise.db

An empty copy of this file will be generated by the app when it first runs.  The path to the file appears in the console window when running the app in the Unity Editor.  I’ve included a copy the DB in the repository root which has twelve dummy questions filled in.  The empty DB should be replaced with this one.

As noted, this project represents one day of work.  It is not complete.  I’ll note three things that are missing.  The UI representing statistics is unfinished.  At present an accumulation of fuzzy dots appears and grows spasmodically.  A gray box appears in the UI where a photo capture is intended to appear.  Lastly, the app is not currently writing statistics back to the DB though the table was created for this purpose.
